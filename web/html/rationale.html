<h2>Diabetes in hospital is sCOMMON</h2>
<p>
Diabetes is a very common condition, affecting an estimated 1 in 20 Canadians. In fact, one in four inpatients has diabetes, and local data in Calgary suggests the prevalence reaches 40% for patients admitted to the Internal Medicine Service. It is estimated that the health care budget contributes $13 billion dollars per year to the care of 2 million Canadians with Diabetes.

<b>Poor Glycemic Control in hospital results in POOR OUTCOMES</b>
<p>
If clinicians fail to recognize and treat hyperglycemia appropriately, diabetic patients are at risk for multi-organ complications, infection, prolonged hospitalization, and increased mortality. As well, hyperglycemia in hospital has been associated with poorer prognosis in patients with stroke, COPD exacerbations, community acquired pneumonia, trauma, acute coronary syndrome, stem cell transplantation, and following surgery.

<b>Improving Glycemic Control can IMPROVE OUTCOMES and REDUCE COST OF CARE</b>
<p>
Improving glycemic control in hospital has been associated with shorter length of stay in hospital and decreased rates of readmission, which in one study resulted in substantial cost-savings of $1500 per patient. Moreover, in a second study, implementing programs focused on treating hyperglycemia led to as much as a 450% return on investment. The Canadian Diabetes Association recognizes that diabetic patients have complex needs while in hospital, and that their acuity of illness, intake and activity are difficult to predict and treat appropriately. It is for these reasons that the CDA has recommended blood glucose targets of 5 to 11 for patients who are admitted to hospital. These targets are higher and more flexible than the typical targets for diabetic patients who are well at home.

The Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) recognizes that diabetic patients have complex needs while in hospital. Their illness, intake and activity are difficult to predict and treat appropriately; therefore, the CDA has recommended blood glucose targets of 5 to 11 mmol/L for patients who are admitted to hospital. These targets are higher and more flexible than the typical targets for diabetic patients who are well at home.
